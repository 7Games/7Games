## Hi, I’m [@7Games](https://github.com/7Games),

I’m interested in Software Development, Games Development, and Tesco for some reason. I’m in College learning Software Development and I work on games in my spare time.

The programming languages I know are; C++, C#, Python, and Java. The game engine I use is [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) with C#.

Please take a look at my website at: [sevengames.xyz](https://sevengames.xyz).
