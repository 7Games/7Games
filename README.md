Hi ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Benjamin. Iâ€™m interested in Software Development and UNIX operating systems. Iâ€™m in currently in college, learning Software Development and I like to work on programs and scripts in my spare time.

I've moved to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/benjaminblack). I will still upload my code here however my main git platform is now Codeberg.
