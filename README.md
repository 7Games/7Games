# Give Up GitHub

I have given up GitHub.  ([See Software Freedom Conservancy's *Give Up  GitHub* site for details](https://GiveUpGitHub.org).)

You can now find me at [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/benjaminblack) instead.

Any use of my project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done without my permission. I do not consent to GitHub's use of any of my project's code in Copilot.

Join us; you can [give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) too!
